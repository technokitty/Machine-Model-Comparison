# Final Project COG118A
There are many types of machine learning algorithms and all of them have their strengths and weaknesses. This project compares three of them: Decision Trees, Random Forest Classifiers, and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) using datasets from the UCI Machine Learning website. This project also studies different partitioning techniques in order to determine which is the best split for training and testing data. It was found that the best split for training and testing data was to have a greater amount of training data than testing data. It was also found that Decision Trees and Random Forest Classifiers performed better than SVMs on the datasets studied. Only one dataset analysis notebook was included in this repository because each dataset was analyzed using the same code. You can read more about all the datasets used and the results found in the pdf included in this repository.
